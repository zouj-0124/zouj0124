Dr. Jiabiao Zou is currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Clean Energy Research Platform, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST). He earned his Ph.D. from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) in 2021, following his foundational studies in Energy and Power Engineering at Nanjing University of Science and Technology (NJUST). Dr. Zouâ€™s research lies at the dynamic intersection of clean energy conversion, advanced combustion diagnostics, and pollutant control strategies. Specializing in precision laser diagnostics, he investigates fundamental physical and chemical phenomena in gas dynamics, high-enthalpy reactive flows, and combustion kinetics. His work plays a pivotal role in unveiling the reaction mechanisms of advanced biofuels and sustainable aviation fuels. Notably, he has established critical connections between stereoisomers, chemical structure, and their oxidation behaviors, relevant to both combustion and atmospheric chemistry. In addition, Dr. Zou is pioneering the use of advanced synchrotron-based mass spectroscopy techniques, including synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectrometry (SVUV-PIMS) and double imaging photoelectron photoion coincidence (i2PEPICO) spectroscopy. These cutting-edge tools allow him to explore chain-branching reaction mechanisms and delve into the complex chemistry of highly oxygenated molecules (HOMs) and secondary organic aerosols (SOAs), contributing significantly to cleaner, more efficient energy solutions.
